# PianoGloves
A small Arduino project

The code in this repo is nearly all taken from this [excellent project](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Synthesizer-With-FM/) by Rolf Oldeman. I just made a few quick hacks for it to work with my small learning Arduino project, the Piano Gloves.

The Piano Gloves are literally gloves with buttons glued on the finger tips, so that when you wear them and tap your fingers against a surface, a melody emerges from a speaker also on the gloves. (In this case, a portion of Fur Elise.)
